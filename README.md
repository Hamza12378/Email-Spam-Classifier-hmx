# Email Spam Classifier by hmx

Welcome to the "Email Spam Classifier" project repository. This project focuses on utilizing machine learning to classify emails as either spam or non-spam based on a provided dataset.

## Contents
### Dataset:
I provide a dataset containing email data, specifically labeled to indicate whether each email is spam or non-spam. This dataset serves as a crucial resource for training and evaluating machine learning models.

### Jupyter Notebook:
The repository includes a Jupyter Notebook file named "Email_Spam_Classifier.ipynb." Within this notebook, we perform the following key tasks:

1. **Data Exploration:** Delve into the dataset to understand its structure, feature distribution, and conduct initial data analysis.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Preprocess the data, addressing issues such as handling missing values, cleaning text, and performing necessary feature engineering.
3. **Machine Learning Models:** Implement machine learning models to classify emails as spam or non-spam. This involves tasks such as data splitting, model training, and comprehensive model evaluation.
4. **Results and Insights:** Present the results and insights derived from the analysis, showcasing the performance of the developed machine learning models.

### Additional Files:
- **Pre-trained Models:** The repository also includes two pre-trained model files in .pkl format, which can be used in projects like Streamlit or Django frameworks without the need for retraining.

### Requirements:
To run the Jupyter Notebook and replicate the analysis, please refer to the requirements outlined in the README file. It is recommended to set up a Python environment with the necessary libraries to facilitate a smooth start.

### How to Use This Repository:
- **Clone the Repository:** Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine using the provided Git clone command.
- **Review the Dataset:** Familiarize yourself with the dataset provided in the "data" directory. Understand the features and the target variable (spam vs. non-spam) for effective model training.
- **Run the Jupyter Notebook:** Execute the Jupyter Notebook "Email_Spam_Classifier.ipynb" to step through the data exploration, preprocessing, model implementation, and results analysis. Additionally, utilize the pre-trained model files for integration into other frameworks.
